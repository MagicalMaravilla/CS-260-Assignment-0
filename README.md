# CS-260-Assignment-0
My intro to CS 260
Topics that interest me:

1.) Algorithims, Algorithims, Algorithims: If I know anything about computer science, its that I need to learn a lot about algorithims, how they apply, what is best for certain senarios, and which ones are overkill and too much for a project, making it unneccsarily resource intensive, or inneffective at what the job needs. I'm ready to learn about the best ones, the worst ones, and the obsure ones.

2.) Hashtables, and Hash functions: While im not an expert or even really know too much about this skill set, I have run into many people who have stopped their computer science degree around a full class of hastables and hash functions, I hope to walk away from this class with a basic understand of what they do, and how they apply to our work in the real world.

3.) Binary Trees: Data is beautiful, and so are Binary trees, showing the paths and functions along the way, about a set of information, that can lead to a variation of answers, based on a handful of selections and where it has lead you.

4.)Queure Structure: Would like to know about priority queues, deques, and circular queues. Applying these in principle to ensure great flow of progress within an application

5.)Graph Thoery: I love that mathematics can give us network analysis, data mining, and more. Its mathematics like this that I love to see applied in real pricipal terms, I do love the theory side of mathematics, but when you see it being automated and processed due to the underlying work of mathematics, its truely a beautiful sight to behold!


Topics I struggle currently with:

1.) General Lack of Tools: 
I feel like im lacking tools, I can code some nice stuff, and it even feels like the real deal, however even with the few thousand lines of code ive written in projects, I feel like I am limited by the basics and look forward to seeing what more I can do with them.

2.)Sometimes I over due a project: I value the skills I'm learning and sometimes go above the original project sometimes, but I need to learn that its ok to do a base project when time is limited, not everything has to have 100 fancy extra things, other than making solid code, that runs, and does what is asked.

3.) API: I hear the word API and I have no clue what that means unless I look it up, I know that some of that is because I have not gone into that realm, I know that it communicates with the back end to move the front end, but i dont know how that works in conjuction with each other or how you would apply that in apps.

4.) Breaking down chuncks of code: trying to get files and calling them up, this is something I am going to focus extra hard on, so I can work through files and if I have an issue I can check if its the logic, or if its the way im applying it, or something else entirely.

5.) BrainStorming Projects Entirely: Sometimes I struggle with not thinking everything out while brainstorming, I try to put in work for it, and somehow I miss one or two big things that I needed to implement in a different way stalling some of my progress, I hope work on that in this class, by taking a day or two extra to brainstorm so when I pursue it, I am coming with great, well thought out, program, accounting for pitfalls.
